        What is this project about?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Evanston residents love their trees. That's why when Dutch Elm Disease and Emerald Ash Borer invasives started to claim the lives of thousands of our park and parkway trees over the past few years, we banded together and took action. It started with a few tree-knowledgeable volunteers helping the City maintain some of our current park trees through mulching and removing invasive plant species, such as buckthorn. As interest spread, the City started the "I Heart Evanston Trees" project in order begin a larger discussion about the threats facing our tree population and potential solutions.

        What is our goal?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We will plant a large variety of native species to improve our tree population's resiliency and support a larger diversity of flora and fauna. We want the millions of birds that pass through Chicagoland each year during migration seasons to take refuge in our city, with an abundance of food and shelter to help ensure a safer journey to their final destination. We want to be a model city to inspire other municipalities to invest in their own green infrastructure, and see the benefits of having cleaner air, reduced storm water run-off, higher property values, and safer neighborhoods thanks to all the families that will enjoy more outdoor time and spend more time getting to know their neighbors.

        What will my donation do?
      </h3>
      <p>
       Every $250 represents a new tree. All of the revenue we raise is going strictly towards the purchase and planting of more trees to replace those that have fallen, and all donations are tax-deductible. With $6,480, we will be able to purchase at least twenty-five 2.5 inch diameter trees from local nurseries.
